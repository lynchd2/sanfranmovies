#About
* San Francisco Movie Locator uses your given address, or a searchable address in San Francisco, and searches for movies produced since 1924 that were filmed at that location. The address does not have to be EXACTLY at the given address(Main Street versus AT 123 Main Street) and will give you the same results.
* This application uses the SF OpenData API to gather statistical information about the movies

# Technical Details
* This app uses Ruby on Rails 5
* Gems used to complete this application include but are not limited to: Geolocator, themoviedb, bcrycpt, bootstrap, and soda-ruby
* You do NOT have to be in San Fransico to use this application. You can very well be in Italy and still search for movies that were filmed in San Fransico as long as you have an address!
* To get the best results, make sure you search EXACTLY the format of the example search bar. You may or may not get the results you were looking for if you include extra information or disclude information.

#Get Access
* The best way to fix/play with/break this application is the fork and clone your own repository. If you fixed something you found to break the application, send a pull request and become a contributer!
